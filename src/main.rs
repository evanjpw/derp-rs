//! # derp-rs
//!
//! A crappy knockoff of "grep" that exists only as a way to teach myself Rust.
//!
//! I have been paying attention to Rust for years, and have seen it
//! evolve over time, but never actually tried to write any Rust code.
//!
//! For personal reasons, it has become of more interest recently, so
//! this seemed an excellent first program, since it had many dimensions
//! for a little program.
//!
//! (Amusingly, [one of the Rust books/online resources][1]
//! uses building `grep` as an exercise. When I saw that, I avoided
//! reading that book further, so as to not contaminate my experience.
//! But it is entertaining that they decided on the same little program
//! to teach Rust. I must be onto something.)
//!
//! ## Usage
//! ```
//! USAGE:
//! derp [FLAGS] <PATTERN> [PATH]...
//!
//! FLAGS:
//! -d               Sets the level of debugging information
//! -h, --help       Prints help information
//! -V, --version    Prints version information
//!
//! ARGS:
//! <PATTERN>    The pattern (regular expression) to search for
//! <PATH>...    The path to search for the pattern
//! ```
